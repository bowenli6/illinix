Checkpoint1:

PIC:
1.  Problem:    Slave Interrupt handler cannot be invoked.
    Reason:     The IRQ2 never get enabled.  
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   Enable IRQ2 in i8259_init() to connect the master PIC and the slave PIC.

Keyboard:
2.  Problem:    Two characters are printed when one key pressed.
    Reason:     One key pressed two interrupts generated with two different scancodes.
    Time used:  2h
    Solution:   Check if the scancode received from PIC is within the number of scannodes(127)
                Discard the interrupt when the number is equal to or greater.
                
3.  Problem:    Only the first key pressed works, the remaining ones do not.
    Reason:     The interrupt handler never returns to the previous instruction address(EIP).
    Time used:  4h
    Solution:   Used a wrapper function written in assembly languages, to save all registers,
                to call the actual handler function written in C by the keyboard driver, and
                to use the iret instruction resumes to the previous state that were saved by
                the CPU before invoking the interruption.
Paging:
4.  Problem:    The machine crashed in page_init()
    Reason:     Used video memory as a array index directly
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   Only use the most significant 8 bits of VIDEO as the memory index

5.  Problem:    page_init() will get the machine stuck
    Reason:     The video memory is not shifted when it is filled into the base address
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   change "VIDEO" to "(VIDEO >> PTE_OFFSET)"
    
IDT:
6.  Problem:    First time loading handler into the IDT table, we could not find the handler.
    Reason:     1) I forgot that handler function could not take parameter
                2) I forgot to take the address of the handler.
                3) Also take time to form and wrap the function, and differentiate them into trap/interrupt/syscall
    Time usedL  2h
    Solution    1) Write indicivual function inorder to eliminate the parameter.
                2) Take address of the handler


RTC:
7.  Problem:    After call test_interrupts, the video memory space is static! Instead of 
                changing characters.
    Reason:     frequency not set correctly and therefore the characters cannot move.
    Time used:  a day
    Solution:   Adjust local function of set_RTC_freq to reject invalid frequencies
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Checkpoint2:

Terminal:
1.  Problem:    Terminal_read never break out of loop.
    Reason:     It only checks if the buffer has \n, not \r.
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   Add \r to the if statement.


File System:
2.  Problem:    Page fault when initializing the file system driver.
    Reason:     Access a vitural address that should not be accessed.
    Time used:  30 min 
    Solution:   (1) When incrmenting the address of the starting location of 
                    the file system, I should check the type of the current 
                    pointer. If the type is inode_t *, I should only add 1 to
                    it so it will be added to the next 4kb address.
                (2) Initializing the file system driver before paging. 
                    (paging will refuse me to access the memory)

3.  Problem:    Directory Always show the same filename.
    Reason:     Did not update file position after reading.
    Time used:  30 min
    Solution:   Update f_pos after reading.

4.  Problem:    Read 0 bytes everytime calling file_read
    Reason:     inode is not the same as dirs index.
    Time used:  1 hour 
    Solution:   Remove the code that check if the current type is not regular file.
                Because in my implmentation, only reading regular files can enter this
                function.

5.  Problem:    Divide by zero exception occurs when reading regular files.
    Reason:     Divide by zero when calcuate The index of the data we want to read.
    Time used:  10 min
    Solution:   Divide by BLOCK_SIZE instead of the index of block because the index 
                could be zero.

6.  Problem:    Reading regular files gives me ELF.. File content is not shown.
    Reason:
    Time used:
    Solution:

Checkpoint1:

PIC:
1.  Problem:    Slave Interrupt handler cannot be invoked.
    Reason:     The IRQ2 never get enabled.  
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   Enable IRQ2 in i8259_init() to connect the master PIC and the slave PIC.

Keyboard:
2.  Problem:    Two characters are printed when one key pressed.
    Reason:     One key pressed two interrupts generated with two different scancodes.
    Time used:  2h
    Solution:   Check if the scancode received from PIC is within the number of scannodes(127)
                Discard the interrupt when the number is equal to or greater.
                
3.  Problem:    Only the first key pressed works, the remaining ones do not.
    Reason:     The interrupt handler never returns to the previous instruction address(EIP).
    Time used:  4h
    Solution:   Used a wrapper function written in assembly languages, to save all registers,
                to call the actual handler function written in C by the keyboard driver, and
                to use the iret instruction resumes to the previous state that were saved by
                the CPU before invoking the interruption.
Paging:
4.  Problem:    The machine crashed in page_init()
    Reason:     Used video memory as a array index directly
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   Only use the most significant 8 bits of VIDEO as the memory index

5.  Problem:    page_init() will get the machine stuck
    Reason:     The video memory is not shifted when it is filled into the base address
    Time used:  1h
    Solution:   change "VIDEO" to "(VIDEO >> PTE_OFFSET)"
    
IDT:
6.  Problem:    First time loading handler into the IDT table, we could not find the handler.
    Reason:     1) I forgot that handler function could not take parameter
                2) I forgot to take the address of the handler.
                3) Also take time to form and wrap the function, and differentiate them into trap/interrupt/syscall
    Time usedL  2h
    Solution    1) Write indicivual function inorder to eliminate the parameter.
                2) Take address of the handler


RTC:
7.  Problem:    After call test_interrupts, the video memory space is static! Instead of 
                changing characters.
    Reason:     frequency not set correctly and therefore the characters cannot move.
    Time used:  a day
    Solution:   Adjust local function of set_RTC_freq to reject invalid frequencies

Paging:
1. The machine crashed in page_init()
Reason: Used video memory as a array index directly
Time used: 1h
Solution: Only use the most significant 8 bits of VIDEO as the memory index

2. page_init() will get the machine stuck
Reason: The video memory is not shifted when it is filled into the base address
Time used: 1h
Solution: change "VIDEO" to "(VIDEO >> PTE_OFFSET)"

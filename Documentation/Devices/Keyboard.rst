Description
-------------------
The keyboard is an input device that allows you to enter letters, numbers and symbols into your
computer. The keyboard keys include the alphanumeric keys (letters and numbers), numeric
keypad (may not be available on netbooks/laptops), special function keys, mouse cursor moving
keys, and status lights.

Each keyboard key has a unique scancode for the keyboard controller to distinguish different keys 
pressed. Thus, the keyboard interrupt can be generated by the controller to the 
**PIC** (Programmable Interrupt Controller), and then the corresponding interrupt handler will be i
nvolved and show your keys to the screen as specified.
